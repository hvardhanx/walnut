# Walnut

### Steps to run the app:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:royalharsh/walnut.git
cd walnut
npm install
npm start
```

### Approach

My main focus was to make the table visually appealing and implement any one feature in the given time. I have implemented the infinite scroll feature and tried to make the table visually appealing within the time limit.

### Features in progress

I started with implementing the graphs using Plotly. So that we could visualize the data in a proper way. But, ran out of time.

### Suggested Features

 - Add a search bar to search through the table.
 - Add a filter option, so that we could choose people with high or low traits or 'married' and 'divorced'.
 - We could also make each customer row more interactive. For example, when the user clicks on a customer row, we could show them all the traits of the user and their timeline.
 - Add tests
 - Add graphs to clearly visualize all the data in customers.json. We could make use of scatter plots, pie charts, line charts.
